NAME: i'm wajiha,
COLLEGE: Currently in my 2nd year pursuing computer science engineering from shadan women's 
college of engineering and technology.
ROLE/SPECIALTY: Specialiesd in front-end (not really, still learning) and the tech i'm comfortable is HTML, CSS, and i also know bit of AI/ML.
IDEA: The idea i actually want to build at EVP is An on-demand service platform that connects people with verified drivers and household helpers. For instance, if someone owns a car but doesn’t know how to drive, doesn’t want to deal with traffic, or even if they’ve had a few drinks and can’t drive safely, they could book a trusted driver to use their own vehicle. Similarly, households could book reliable help for daily tasks like cleaning, cooking, or childcare. The vision is to make everyday life safer, more convenient, and trustworthy whether it’s getting home responsibly or getting chores done through one simple app.

BYE! THAT'S IT HEHEHE
